              <p>
                Current on its first iteration, TXE is an organization that I founded along with
                two of my friends. Established in the summer of 2020, our vision is a community
                of self-motivated and remarkable individuals who are deeply interested in technology
                and its power to change the world.<br><br>
                Through the many obstacles the organization has faced in 2020, I now
                understand the difficulties of building a virtual community.
                And more importantly, I now understand the aspects of running an organization: many hours of
                behind-the-scenes work and many failed test runs.<br><br>
                I would like to thank our members for their patience and second-chances.<br>
                For more information about TXE, feel free to check us out <a href="https://tauchiepsilon.org">here</a>.

              <h1>Internship at Tech-X</h1>
              <p>
                Despite COVID restrictions, Tech-X was gracious enough to invite me to intern for summer 2020.
                It is difficult for me to sum up my experiences at Tech-X in a single paragraph. But, I want
                to express my gratitude for the company for their unwaving support and patience as they took
                a chance on me despite having no prior experiences or knowledge of the material.<br>
                I have taken away a lot of lessons

              <h1>Michigan Ballroom Dance Team</h1>
              <p>
                Ballroom taught me how to dance; dance when it mattered most
                and dance when no one is looking.<br>
                As an art, ballroom has many rules, and I have not yet learned all of 
                them. But like all art, it is a medium of expression, and 
                I have learned to express myself in another way. <br>
                Just to name a few lessons I have learned:<br>
                <ul>
                  <li>How to effectively communicate, sometimes even without words</li>
                  <li>How to show up day after day, and still have as much energy as the very first</li>
                  <li>How to cheer for other teammates</li>
                  <li>How to entrust in your partner, and surrender control</li>
                  <li>How to take criticism and reflect on your own shortcomings</li>
                  <li>How to smile and keep smiling</li>
                </ul>

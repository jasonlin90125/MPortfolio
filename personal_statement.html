        <h1>My Personal Statement</h1>
        <h3>My life purpose is to use my creativity and authenticity to inspire 
            and motivate people to reach their true potential and enact purposeful 
            change in the world. I envision a future for me where I am actively working to 
            improve science and push the boundaries of knowledge. </h3>
        <h3>That mindset to further advance the world will likewise bleed into my 
            personal life, where I will work to better myself in all aspects of life. 
            Every interest and activity I have picked up has taught me something different 
            about the world. I believe that the simple act of obtaining a collection of 
            perspectives builds one's character. I intend to gain different perspectives of 
            this world through the deliberate practice of learning and acquiring experiences. 
            I wish to view the same horizon with different spyglasses, devices obtained from 
            devoting one's energy for a long time.</h3>  
        <h3>Along the way, I hope to become a mentor and a role model to the people I meet. 
            I believe that teaching and helping others to become the best version of themselves, 
            as a way of giving, is the way to gain great fulfillment in this life. Likewise, 
            I wish to meet those who can give me guidance and are a paragon of who I wish to 
            become.</h3>
        <h3>The people who I truly respect are not defined by their achievements or 
            status. I respect the individuals who show great character, especially in times 
            of great peril. I admire one's authenticity, tenacity, dedication, drive, and integrity. 
            I commend those whose actions are louder than their words, those who stick to their 
            values even when it is not favourable to do so. And I hope to become such a 
            person and instill similar ideals to those around me.</h3>
